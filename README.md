# Risk-Adjusted Operations Prioritization 
### Under Cost & Execution Variance

## What this project is
This is a decision-focused Business Analyst project, not a dashboard or visualization exercise.

The project demonstrates how an Operations Manager can prioritize limited intervention capacity across production cycles when:
- performance data is noisy
- averages hide risk
- cost leakage is concentrated in the tail
- good outcomes can hide bad execution
- bad outcomes can hide good execution
- management attention is the scarcest resource

The emphasis is on **decision logic**, **risk-aware prioritization**, and **managerial defensibility**.

## Core business decision
**Which production cycles should management intervene in next quarter when time, people, and capital are constrained?**

The decision is made under:
- execution variability
- imperfect signals
- delayed feedback
- asymmetric downside risk

---

## Decision owner
Operations Manager (plant / cluster level)

This role is accountable for:
- operational outcomes
- cost control
- intervention prioritization
- escalation decisions

---

## What this project deliberately avoids
- Dashboard-first thinking  
- KPI overload  
- Tool-driven analysis  
- Retrospective storytelling  
- Optimization theater  

Every artifact exists to support a **forward-looking managerial decision**.

## Dataset overview
- Real poultry operations data at cycle level
- Daily operational data aggregated to cycles
- Benchmarks, costs, harvest outputs
- Separate simulated stress dataset for downside testing

> Raw data is not published to protect commercial sensitivity.  
> All logic, assumptions, and decision structure are fully transparent.

## How to read this repository
1. Start with **01_Decision_Context** to understand the problem framing
2. Move to **02_Decision_Decomposition** to see how the decision is structured
3. Review **03_Data_and_Inputs** for data credibility and limits
4. Analysis and recommendations follow only after decision clarity

This ordering mirrors how a senior analyst should think — not how tools encourage you to work.

## Intended audience
- Hiring managers evaluating Business Analysts
- Operations leaders assessing decision quality
- Interview panels testing judgment under uncertainty

---

## Author intent
This project is designed to be:
- interview-defensible
- decision-first
- senior-analyst aligned
- resistant to hindsight bias

It reflects how real operational decisions are made under constraint — not how clean case studies are written.
