# Risk-Adjusted Operations Prioritization  
### Decision-Focused Business Analyst Portfolio Project

## What This Project Is
This project demonstrates how a Business Analyst supports **real operational decisions under uncertainty**, where:
- Management attention is limited
- Performance signals are noisy
- Averages hide true execution risk

The core problem addressed is **where management should intervene—and where it should not—when not everything can be fixed at once**.

---

## Decision Context
An Operations Manager must decide which production cycles to prioritize for intervention in the upcoming quarter to reduce:
- cost leakage
- execution instability
- hidden operational risk

Decisions must be made **before outcomes are known**, using imperfect data.

---

## What This Project Demonstrates
- Decision framing under ambiguity
- Scope control and governance discipline
- KPI restraint (no metric sprawl)
- Risk-adjusted prioritization logic
- Explicit trade-offs and decision rules
- Misclassification risk awareness
- Post-decision monitoring and iteration

This is **not** a dashboard or reporting showcase.

---

## What This Project Is NOT
- ❌ A Power BI dashboard demo  
- ❌ A performance ranking exercise  
- ❌ A forecasting or optimization model  
- ❌ A data science or ML project  

Power BI is used **only as supporting evidence**, not as the deliverable.
