# Executive Decision Memo  
## Risk-Adjusted Operations Prioritization

### Decision Owner
Operations Manager

### Decision Required
Determine which production cycles should be prioritized for management intervention in the upcoming quarter, given limited intervention capacity and noisy performance signals.

---

## Context

Operational performance varies widely across production cycles due to a combination of execution differences and uncontrollable external stressors (labor availability, weather, cost shocks, demand timing).

Headline metrics and averages obscure true execution risk, leading to misallocation of management attention.

---

## Key Insight

Execution risk is **concentrated in a small subset of cycles**, not evenly distributed.

Several cycles that appear financially acceptable exhibit:
- Persistent efficiency deviations
- Elevated irreversible losses
- High cost exposure driven by execution behavior
- Large variance relative to benchmarks

Conversely, some low-outcome cycles demonstrate stable execution once uncontrollable factors are considered.

---

## Options Considered

1. **Broad Intervention Coverage**  
   - High visibility, low impact per intervention, high disruption

2. **Outcome-Based Reactive Intervention**  
   - Simple but misses hidden execution risk

3. **Risk-Adjusted Targeted Intervention (Recommended)**  
   - Focuses attention where execution risk is persistent and controllable

---

## Recommendation

Adopt a **risk-adjusted, targeted intervention approach**.

Intervene only in cycles where multiple execution-risk signals align, regardless of short-term financial outcomes. Monitor borderline cycles and avoid disrupting stable cycles affected by uncontrollable shocks.

---

## Why This Works

- Aligns with limited management capacity
- Surfaces hidden execution risk early
- Reduces likelihood of compounding failures
- Remains robust under simulated stress conditions
- Preserves managerial judgment

---

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Risk:** Misclassification of some cycles  
  **Mitigation:** Monitoring tier and post-decision review

- **Risk:** Overreliance on composite scoring  
  **Mitigation:** Component transparency and confidence labeling

---

## Next Steps

- Execute targeted interventions
- Monitor execution response weekly
- Review misclassifications at cycle end
- Refine benchmarks and weighting logic as needed

---

### One-Line Summary

> Allocate management attention based on execution risk, not headline outcomes.
