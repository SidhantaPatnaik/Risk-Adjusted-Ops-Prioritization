# Problem Framing & Scope Control

## Core Problem
Operational performance varies significantly across production cycles. Some cycles appear profitable while others show cost leakage, losses, or instability. However, headline outcomes and averages mask true execution risk.

The real problem is **not poor performance in isolation**.

The real problem is **misallocation of scarce management intervention capacity**.

## Why Uneven Performance Exists

### Structural Constraints
- Limited management time and supervisory bandwidth
- Capital tied up in feed, power, and working capital
- Inability to actively manage all cycles simultaneously

### External Stressors (Largely Uncontrollable)
- Festival-related labor shortages
- Demand fluctuations driven by market and cultural timing
- Weather volatility affecting power usage and stability
- Input cost shocks (feed, energy, logistics)

These factors distort observed performance and inflate costs unevenly across cycles.

## Why Averages Fail
- Averages hide tail risk
- Profitable outcomes can mask fragile execution
- Poor outcomes can penalize disciplined cycles affected by bad luck
- Variance, not central tendency, drives operational risk

## What This Project Solves
This project reframes the challenge as:

> **How should management allocate limited intervention capacity across cycles to reduce future execution and cost risk under noisy performance signals?**

---

## What This Project Explicitly Does NOT Solve
To avoid false precision and scope creep, the following are out of scope:
- Predicting weather, demand, or power availability
- Adjusting performance for religious or cultural calendars
- Causal modeling of feed, heat, or electricity effects
- Daily operations optimization
- Personnel performance evaluation
- Enterprise-wide dashboarding
