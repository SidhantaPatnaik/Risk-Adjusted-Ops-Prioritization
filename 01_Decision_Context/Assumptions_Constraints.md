# Assumptions & Constraints

## Why Assumptions Are Explicit
Decisions must be made under uncertainty, incomplete data, and real-world constraints. Assumptions are declared upfront to protect decision quality and prevent overclaiming.

## Hard Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

### Limited Intervention Capacity
Management can intervene in only a small subset of cycles due to time, people, and capital constraints.

### Decision Timing
Decisions occur before or during execution, not after outcomes are realized.

### Control Boundary
Management cannot directly control:
- Labor availability during festivals
- Weather and power reliability
- Market demand timing
- Sudden input cost shocks

## Declared Assumptions

**A1 — Benchmarks Represent Reasonable Execution**  
Benchmarks reflect expected performance under disciplined execution, not best-case outcomes.

**A2 — Variance Is More Informative Than Averages**  
Cycle-level variance is a stronger signal of execution risk than mean performance.

**A3 — Some Outcomes Are Luck-Driven**  
Good outcomes may occur despite weak execution and vice versa.

**A4 — Not All Inefficiency Is Fixable**  
Some deviations are driven by uncontrollable stressors.

**A5 — Decision Quality Matters More Than Metric Precision**  
Directional accuracy is acceptable where precision is infeasible.

## Explicit Non-Assumptions
This framework does not assume:
- Stable labor availability
- Predictable weather
- Constant input prices
- Linear relationships between inputs and outcomes
- Guaranteed success of interventions
