   Defines who owns the decision and what decision is being supported.

2. **Problem_Framing.md**

3. **Assumptions_Constraints.md**  
   Documents constraints, assumptions, and control boundaries.

4. **KPI_Definitions.md**  
   Defines the limited set of decision-relevant KPIs.

5. **Data_Governance.md**  
   Establishes data trust, validation rules, and decision safety.
