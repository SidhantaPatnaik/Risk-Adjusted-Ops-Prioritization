# KPI Definitions (Decision-Locked)

This project intentionally limits KPIs to six decision-relevant measures. Each KPI must directly support intervention prioritization.

---

## 1. Feed / Input Efficiency
**Question:** How effectively were inputs converted into output compared to expectation?

Used as a directional indicator of execution discipline.

---

## 2. Mortality / Loss Rate
**Question:** How much irreversible value was lost during execution?

High-confidence indicator of downside risk.

---

## 3. Yield per Cycle
**Question:** What output was realized relative to cycle scale?

Outcome signal used to detect false positives and negatives.

---

## 4. Cost per Unit Outcome
**Question:** How expensive was each unit of realized output?

Translates execution issues into economic terms.

---

## 5. Variance vs Benchmark
**Question:** How far did performance deviate from expected levels?

Central signal for identifying risk concentration.

---

## 6. Composite Risk-Adjusted Cycle Score
**Question:** How risky is this cycle as a candidate for management intervention?

Used only for ranking cycles under capacity constraints.

---

## Governance Rule
No KPI is interpreted in isolation. Intervention decisions require alignment across multiple signals.
