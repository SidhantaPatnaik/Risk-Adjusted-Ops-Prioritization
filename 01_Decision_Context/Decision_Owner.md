# Decision Owner & Context

## Primary Decision Owner
**Operations Manager**

The Operations Manager is accountable for quarterly operational performance, cost control, and execution stability across production cycles. This role owns the decision on where to allocate limited management attention, supervisory effort, and corrective interventions.

This project exists to **support the judgment of this role**, not to replace it.

---

## Decision Being Supported
> *If management can actively intervene in only a small subset of production cycles in the next quarter, which cycles should be prioritized for intervention—and which should not—to minimize risk-adjusted cost leakage and execution failure?*

This is a forward-looking prioritization decision made under uncertainty.

---

## Decision Timing
- Decision is made **before or during cycle execution**
- Final outcomes are not known at decision time
- Waiting for perfect information is not feasible

---

## Stakeholders (Non-Decision Owners)

| Stakeholder | Role |
|------------|------|
| Finance | Validates cost exposure |
| Site / Farm Leads | Receive interventions |
| Supply & Feed Planning | Adjusts inputs |
| Senior Management | Reviews decision logic |
| Analytics | Supports measurement |

Stakeholders may influence or challenge the decision, but **do not own it**.

---

## Explicit Exclusions
This decision is **not** about:
- Ranking farms or people
- Explaining historical performance
- Maximizing profit in hindsight
- Building monitoring dashboards
- Forecasting demand or prices
