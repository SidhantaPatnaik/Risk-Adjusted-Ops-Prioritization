# Limitations & Risks

This project intentionally prioritizes decision quality over analytical precision.

Key limitations include:
- Reliance on internal benchmarks
- Directional interpretation of cost allocations
- Inability to control external stressors
- Limited historical depth

These limitations are explicitly acknowledged and managed through:
- Confidence classification
- Monitoring tiers
- Stress testing
- Post-decision review

The framework is designed to be robust, not perfect.
