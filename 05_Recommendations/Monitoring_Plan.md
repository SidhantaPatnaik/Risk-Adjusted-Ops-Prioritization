# Post-Decision Monitoring Plan

## Purpose

No decision framework is perfect at first use.  
This plan defines how decisions are monitored, reviewed, and improved without stalling execution.

---

## What to Monitor After Intervention

### For Intervened Cycles
- Change in execution efficiency
- Stabilization or reduction in loss rates
- Cost per unit trend
- Reduction in variance

### For Monitored Cycles
- Persistence of risk signals
- Escalation or resolution of deviations
- Emergence of new loss patterns

---

## Monitoring Cadence

- **Weekly:** High-risk cycles under active intervention
- **Bi-weekly:** Medium-risk cycles under monitoring
- **End of cycle:** Outcome review for learning, not blame

---

## Decision Review Triggers

The framework should be revisited if:
- Interventions repeatedly fail to improve execution
- High-risk cycles were missed (false negatives)
- Stable cycles were unnecessarily disrupted (false positives)
- Benchmarks or cost structures materially change

---

## How Learning Is Applied

- Misclassifications are documented
- Weighting logic is adjusted transparently
- Assumptions are revisited explicitly
- No silent changes to rules

---

## Governance Principle

Monitoring is used to:
- Improve decision quality
- Refine prioritization logic
- Increase confidence over time

It is **not** used for:
- Retrospective punishment
- Metric gaming
- Blame assignment

---

## Summary

This monitoring plan ensures that the prioritization framework remains:
- Adaptive
- Trustworthy
- Aligned with operational reality
