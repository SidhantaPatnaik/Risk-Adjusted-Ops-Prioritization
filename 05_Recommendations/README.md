# Phase 5 — Options, Recommendation & Monitoring

This folder contains the **decision output** of the project.

After establishing decision context, analytical design, and evidence, this phase:
- Lays out realistic strategic options
- Makes a clear, defensible recommendation
- Defines how the decision should be monitored and refined over time

This phase is written from the perspective of **supporting a real management decision**, not presenting analysis for its own sake.

---

## How to Read This Folder

Files should be read in the following order:

### 1. **Options_Analysis.md**
Presents the realistic choices available to management, including:
- Broad intervention
- Risk-adjusted targeted intervention
- Outcome-based reactive intervention

Each option is evaluated with explicit trade-offs, risks, and capacity implications.

---

### 2. **Final_Recommendation.md**
States the recommended course of action and explains:
- What management should do
- What management should explicitly avoid
- Why this choice is defensible under uncertainty

This is the **decision call**, not a summary of analysis.

---

### 3. **Monitoring_Plan.md**
Defines how the decision should be:
- Monitored after implementation
- Reviewed for misclassification
- Iterated without stalling execution

This ensures the framework remains a **living decision system**, not a one-time analysis.

---

## Key Principle

This phase intentionally prioritizes:
- Judgment over optimization
- Trade-offs over “best answers”
- Decision safety over metric precision

The goal is not to eliminate uncertainty, but to **manage it responsibly**.
