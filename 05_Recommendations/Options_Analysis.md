# Options Analysis

## Decision Context Recap

Management has limited capacity to intervene across production cycles.  
Not all execution risk can be addressed simultaneously.

The following options represent **realistic strategic choices**, not theoretical optimizations.

---

## Option 1 — Broad Intervention Coverage

### Description
Intervene across a large number of cycles showing any signs of inefficiency or deviation.

### Advantages
- Maximizes visible action
- Reduces the chance of missing emerging issues
- Signals strong management oversight

### Trade-offs
- Dilutes management attention
- High risk of false positives
- Disrupts stable cycles unnecessarily
- Low marginal impact per intervention

### Risk Profile
- Lower risk of missing problems
- Higher risk of wasted effort and fatigue

---

## Option 2 — Risk-Adjusted Targeted Intervention (Preferred)

### Description
Intervene only in cycles where **multiple execution-risk signals align**, as identified by the prioritization framework.

### Advantages
- Concentrates effort where impact is highest
- Surfaces hidden execution risk early
- Minimizes disruption to stable cycles
- Aligns with limited management capacity

### Trade-offs
- Accepts some false negatives
- Requires trust in decision logic
- May appear conservative in the short term

### Risk Profile
- Balanced exposure
- Survivable errors preferred over silent failure

---

## Option 3 — Outcome-Based Reactive Intervention

### Description
Intervene primarily in cycles with poor financial or output outcomes.

### Advantages
- Simple to explain
- Easy to execute
- Aligns with traditional performance reviews

### Trade-offs
- Misses hidden execution risk
- Overreacts to uncontrollable shocks
- Encourages firefighting over prevention

### Risk Profile
- High likelihood of delayed failure
- Poor early warning capability

## Comparative Summary

| Option | Focus | Risk of False Positives | Risk of False Negatives | Management Load |
|------|------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| Broad Coverage | Visibility | High | Low | Very High |
| Risk-Adjusted Targeted | Execution Risk | Moderate | Moderate | Controlled |
| Outcome-Based | Results | Low | High | Medium |

---

## Option Suitability

- Option 1 is suitable only when excess management capacity exists
- Option 3 is suitable only when decisions are purely retrospective
- Option 2 is most suitable when:
  - Capacity is constrained
  - Early risk detection matters
  - Execution stability is a priority

---

## Transition to Recommendation

Given the decision constraints and risk profile, the next step is to select the option that best balances **impact, effort, and decision safety**.
