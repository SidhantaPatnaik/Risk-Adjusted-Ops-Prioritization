# Final Recommendation

## Recommendation Summary

Adopt a **risk-adjusted, targeted intervention approach** for the upcoming decision cycle.

Management should intervene only in production cycles where **multiple execution-risk signals align**, rather than reacting to headline outcomes or broad inefficiency indicators.

This approach best balances:
- Limited intervention capacity
- Risk of misclassification
- Need for early detection of hidden execution risk

---

## What Management Should Do

1. **Prioritize High-Risk Cycles**
   - Focus on cycles with aligned signals across efficiency, loss, cost exposure, and variance
   - Intervene even if short-term outcomes appear acceptable

2. **Monitor Borderline Cycles**
   - Maintain visibility on medium-risk cycles
   - Escalate only if signals persist or worsen

3. **Protect Stable Cycles**
   - Avoid disrupting cycles with stable execution
   - Accept short-term outcome volatility driven by uncontrollable factors

---

## What Management Should Explicitly NOT Do

- Do not intervene based on profit or yield alone
- Do not attempt to fix every deviation simultaneously
- Do not treat the composite score as a performance rating
- Do not override the framework due to isolated anomalies
- Do not delay action waiting for perfect information

---

## Why This Recommendation Is Defensible

This recommendation is defensible because it:
- Aligns with real-world capacity constraints
- Surfaces hidden execution risk early
- Prefers survivable errors over silent compounding failures
- Remains robust under simulated stress conditions
- Preserves managerial judgment rather than replacing it

---

## Confidence Level

**High confidence** for adoption as a decision framework.  
**Medium confidence** on exact cycle classification, mitigated through monitoring and review.

---

## Executive Summary (One-Line)

> *Allocate management attention to cycles with persistent execution risk rather than reacting to short-term outcomes.*
