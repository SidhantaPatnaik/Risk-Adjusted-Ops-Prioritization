# Misclassification Risk

## Why Misclassification Matters

This prioritization framework allocates limited management attention.  
Incorrect classification does not just affect metrics — it affects time, morale, and future risk.

Therefore, misclassification risk is explicitly acknowledged and managed.

## Types of Misclassification

### 1. False Positives  
*(Intervening when intervention was not needed)*

**What this looks like:**
- A cycle is flagged for intervention despite acceptable execution
- Deviations were driven by temporary or uncontrollable factors
- Intervention yields little or no improvement

**Costs of false positives:**
- Wasted management time
- Unnecessary disruption to stable teams
- Reduced trust in the prioritization framework
- Risk of over-managing low-risk cycles

**Why false positives occur:**
- Benchmark sensitivity
- External stressors temporarily inflating variance
- Incomplete data at decision time

---

### 2. False Negatives  
*(Failing to intervene when intervention was needed)*

**What this looks like:**
- A cycle appears acceptable due to favorable outcomes
- Underlying execution discipline is weak
- Risks compound and surface later as major failures

**Costs of false negatives:**
- Escalating cost leakage
- Sudden execution breakdowns
- Larger corrective effort required later
- Management surprise and loss of control

**Why false negatives occur:**
- Luck-driven outcomes masking poor execution
- Overreliance on headline profit or yield
- Underweighting variance and loss signals

---

## Relative Severity of Errors

This framework treats **false negatives as more costly than false positives**.

Rationale:
- False positives consume time but are reversible
- False negatives allow hidden risk to compound
- The cost of delayed intervention is typically nonlinear

Therefore, the framework is intentionally conservative toward **surfacing hidden execution risk**.

## Risk Mitigation Safeguards

To manage misclassification risk, the framework includes:

- Confidence labels (High / Medium / Hypothesis)
- Monitoring as an intermediate action
- Explicit exclusion rules for uncontrollable factors
- Post-intervention review to validate signals

No single signal triggers irreversible action.

---

## Learning Loop

Misclassifications are treated as inputs for improvement, not failures.

After each intervention cycle:
- False positives are analyzed to refine thresholds
- False negatives are reviewed to strengthen early signals
- Benchmark assumptions are revisited

The framework evolves through use.

## Summary

This prioritization logic does not assume perfect information.  
It explicitly manages the risk of being wrong by:
- Acknowledging uncertainty
- Preferring survivable errors
- Embedding learning into the decision process
