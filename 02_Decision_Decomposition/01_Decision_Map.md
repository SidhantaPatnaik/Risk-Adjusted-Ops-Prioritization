# Decision Decomposition: Intervention Prioritization

## Purpose of this decomposition
The core decision — *which production cycles to intervene in* — is not binary and cannot be answered by a single metric.

This decomposition breaks the decision into a small number of judgment-led sub-decisions that together determine **whether intervention is warranted, urgent, and feasible**.

The intent is to:
- prevent metric-chasing
- avoid reacting to noise
- focus management attention where downside risk is highest

---

## Primary decision
**Should this production cycle receive management intervention next quarter?**

This decision is evaluated **cycle by cycle**, under capacity constraints.

---

## Sub-decision 1: Is performance meaningfully off-track?
This asks whether the cycle shows **material deviation**, not just variance.

Key idea:
- Small deviations are expected in operations
- Intervention is justified only when deviation is economically or operationally significant

This sub-decision filters out:
- normal process noise
- statistically insignificant swings
- overreaction to single outcomes

---

## Sub-decision 2: Is the deviation driven by execution or external factors?
This distinguishes:
- controllable execution issues
- from uncontrollable or one-off external effects

Key idea:
- Management intervention is effective only when execution is the root cause
- Penalizing uncontrollable variance destroys trust and wastes attention

This sub-decision protects against:
- blaming teams for weather, market, or biological variance
- misdirected corrective action

---

## Sub-decision 3: Is downside risk concentrated or diffuse?
This evaluates whether:
- losses are tail-heavy
- cost leakage accelerates beyond thresholds
- risk compounds if left unattended

Key idea:
- Averages hide tail risk
- Management attention should follow **risk concentration**, not mean performance

This sub-decision elevates:
- cycles that may look acceptable on average
- but carry asymmetric downside exposure

---

## Sub-decision 4: Can intervention realistically change the outcome?
This checks feasibility.

Key idea:
- Not all problems are solvable within the next cycle
- Intervention capacity is limited and must be spent where impact is plausible

This sub-decision prevents:
- symbolic interventions
- late-stage micromanagement
- false accountability

---

## Sub-decision 5: What is the opportunity cost of intervening here?
This forces explicit trade-offs.

Key idea:
- Every intervention crowds out another
- Choosing one cycle implicitly deprioritizes others

This sub-decision ensures:
- prioritization is comparative, not absolute
- attention is allocated across the portfolio, not in isolation

---

## Decision rule (conceptual)
A cycle is prioritized for intervention only when:
- deviation is material,
- execution is a meaningful driver,
- downside risk is concentrated,
- intervention is feasible,
- and opportunity cost is justified.

No single KPI is sufficient to answer this alone.
