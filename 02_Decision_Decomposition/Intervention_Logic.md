# Intervention Logic

## Purpose of This Logic

Given limited management capacity, not all production cycles can receive active intervention.  
This logic defines **which cycles warrant attention**, **which require monitoring**, and **which should be left alone**, even if their outcomes appear weak.

The objective is to allocate management attention where it can reduce **future execution and cost risk**.

---

## Intervention Categories

Each cycle is classified into one of three categories:

1. Immediate Intervention
2. Monitor Closely
3. No Action Required

---

## 1. Immediate Intervention

A cycle qualifies for immediate intervention if **multiple execution-risk signals align**, regardless of headline outcomes.

### Typical characteristics:
- Persistent negative deviation from benchmarks
- Elevated mortality or irreversible losses
- High cost per unit driven by controllable factors
- Large variance indicating unstable execution

### Important clarification:
A cycle **does not need to be unprofitable** to qualify.  
Profitable cycles with fragile execution are valid intervention targets.

**Management intent:**  
Prevent future failure, not react to past outcomes.

---

## 2. Monitor Closely

A cycle qualifies for monitoring if:
- One or two risk signals are present
- Data confidence is medium
- External stressors may explain part of the deviation

### Typical characteristics:
- Mixed signals across KPIs
- Moderate variance without clear execution failure
- Cost pressure with unclear controllability

**Management intent:**  
Avoid premature intervention while maintaining visibility.

Monitoring may escalate to intervention if signals persist.

---

## 3. No Action Required

A cycle qualifies for no action if:
- Execution signals are stable
- Deviations are explainable by uncontrollable factors
- Risk-adjusted indicators do not justify attention

### Important clarification:
This includes cycles with:
- Temporarily poor outcomes driven by external shocks
- Good execution discipline despite unfavorable conditions

**Management intent:**  
Protect teams from unnecessary disruption and misclassification.

---

## Explicit Exclusion Rules

Management will **not intervene** solely because:
- A cycle underperformed due to weather or power outages
- Input costs increased due to market shocks
- Demand timing affected realized outcomes
- Short-term volatility without persistent signals

These factors are treated as **noise**, not execution failure.

---

## Summary

This intervention logic ensures that:
- Management attention is focused where it can make a difference
- Good execution is not penalized for bad luck
- Hidden execution risk is surfaced early
- Decisions remain defensible under uncertainty
