# Decision Decomposition

## What Uncertainty Blocks Action?

The key uncertainties that make this decision difficult are:

### 1. Execution vs Luck
Cycles may have similar outcomes for very different reasons:
- Some cycles succeed due to disciplined execution
- Some succeed due to favorable external conditions
- Some fail due to poor execution despite favorable conditions
- Some fail due to uncontrollable stressors

Without isolating execution quality, decisions may reinforce luck rather than discipline.

---

### 2. Noise vs True Risk
Observed performance is noisy:
- Weather effects impact cost and performance but are not management-controllable
- Input cost fluctuations distort cost metrics
- Labor availability varies unpredictably
- Headline profit hides execution risk

Management must avoid reacting to noise rather than true risk.

---

### 3. Controllability vs Uncontrollability
Decisions must focus on **controllable factors** (where intervention can improve outcomes) and not punish uncontrollable variance.

Examples:
- Corrective feed adjustments or supervision
- Process discipline improvements

Not directly actionable:
- Weather-driven outcomes
- Input cost shocks outside management control

---

## What Signals Matter?

Signals that carry decision-relevant information:

### A. Persistent Deviations from Benchmarks
Not one-off blips, but **consistent inefficiencies** that indicate poor execution.

---

### B. High Mortality / Loss
Irrecoverable loss is a strong negative signal.

---

### C. High Cost per Unit Outcome (Controllable Portion)
Elevated cost driven by execution rather than external shocks.

---

### D. Variance Magnitude (Tail Risk)
Large variances — even in profitable cycles — indicate hidden risk.

---

## What Signals Are Noise or Less Relevant?

The following are treated as noise in the decision framework:

- Short-lived cost spikes due to external shocks
- Outcome success driven solely by favorable conditions
- Power outages not related to execution discipline
- Demand changes not controllable by operations

---

## What Management Can Act On

Management intervention is effective where:
- Execution variance arises from process discipline
- Input utilization can be corrected
- Losses are linked to controllable behaviors

Management cannot directly change:
- Weather
- Festival-induced labor patterns
- Price shocks

---

## Summary

This decomposition clarifies that the key uncertainty is separating **true execution risk** from **noise and luck**.  
The decision logic must therefore prioritize cycles where controllable risk factors dominate observed performance deviations.
This framework intentionally avoids optimizing for outcomes and instead optimizes for decision quality.
